# Paper Analysis

## Categorization of free-text drug orders

- Need to get free text drug order entries.
- Split text and then order by descedning.
- Manully annotate top entries and then train model.

## Changes from paper

- We will need to use NDC for drug codes as opposed to ATC which was used in the paper.
